This is the output of the program I_Permutations_and_inverses_Order_2_to_7.java, which gives the list of all permutations of 2 elements and their inverses.
NOTATION: The n! permutations of a set of n elements are labeled here with P#X, with X=0,...,(n!-1)
************************************
Permutation P#0
1 2
The inverse permutation (P#0)^(-1) = P#0
1 2
************
Permutation P#1
2 1
The inverse permutation (P#1)^(-1) = P#1
2 1
