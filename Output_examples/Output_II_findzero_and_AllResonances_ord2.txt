This is the output of the program II_findzero_and_AllResonances_ord2_to_6.java, which gives the list of semigroups of order 2 with zero element and resonant decompositions.
The number of semigroups with zero elements and at least one resonance, as well as the total number of different resonances is given at the end of the file.
************************************
There are 0 semigroups with zero element and at least one resonance. In total, they have 0 different resonances.
